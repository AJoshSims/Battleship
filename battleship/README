To place only a submarine and a destroyer on each grid 
(for easier win conditions of the battleship game)
	1. Navigate to the file named Grid.java
		(The file path is <wherever>/battleship/src/server/Grid.java)
	2. Search through the source code therein for the expression "remainingShipSegments = placeShipsFew();"
		(It is located within the 
		Grid(String username, int boardSize) constructor)
	3. Replace that expression with "remainingShipSegments = placeShips();"
	4. Run the program like usual.
